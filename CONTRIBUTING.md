# Please No PRs

Contributing to this project is not considered as this is a solo project for the school. So PRs will not be reviewed. Sorry about that.

If you really want to participate into this project, you may create an issue to state what bugs you found / what features you would like to have. Cool ideas are very welcome. I will try my best to implement.
